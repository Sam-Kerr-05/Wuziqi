Go-Moku or Wuziqi is a traditional Japanese game (similar to Go) where two players must find a way to compose a five-space line made up of their respective pieces. The name officially translates to: “five points” – the initial game can be likened to the rules of: ‘tic-tac-toe'.

## Background:
A small section dedicated to the history of the game:
:- 
First made in Japan in 270BC, as part of the game: “Gobang”  (which utilises both the same board and pieces), the Asian board game is said to be over 4000 years old and was originally named: “Kakugo” – which directly translates to; “five-steps” – denoting the key trope of five in a row. 
In the book written in 100AD, they describe the game; “Go” as a national past-time in Japan – similar to the way in which chess is viewed in western cultures. Furthermore, the game has since evolved and was first introduced into Britain in the 19th Century, where it was referred to as; “Go-Bang” and in 1885, ‘Go-Moku’ was introduced to the European culture where it was labelled: “Spoil Five”.
To this day Go-Moku remains one of the most popular Japanese games – alongside other ones like: “Alpha-Go”. The Renju International Foundation  conduct international events and competitions for professional Go-Moku players – the Hungarian chairman of the committee: Attila Demjan founded the RIF on the 8th of August 1998.
